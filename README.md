#Submodule init

# A few rules

	* Each contributor has his own branch (to prevent merge conflicts)
		- git checkout -b <branch_name>
	* Each commit to from a branch 'master' needs to be discussed beforehand
		(with the exceptions of test benches)
	* Always 'git pull' when checking out on 'master'

That's it ;)
