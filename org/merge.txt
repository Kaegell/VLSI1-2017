This file shows for each code file  :
whose version has been chosen,
what was the file's previous name and
what is it's new name in the new branch

Trucs a faire:
 - Ecrire le/les makefile
 - Recuperer le code asm pgcd en salle sesi
 - C'est quoi start.s ?
 - What is C_model ?

Principe :
An imbrication level in the entity/instance arborescence
equals an imbrication level in the file arborescence

[X] build/          Makefiles
[X] bin/            Binaries from vhdl files (folder generated by makefiles)
[X] doc/            PDFs (documentation, tme summaries...)
[ ] misc/           Miscellaneous files
[ ] org/            All files, tables, etc. regarding the project's organization and avancement
[ ] src/            Vhdl source code
[ ] test/           C and Asm source code

About src/ :
 - One entity = one file
 - The file arborescence is equivalent to the entity arborescence
   (which means if entity A in instanciate within entity B, there will be
   a/
     a.vhdl
     b/
       b.vhdl
   In other words, an imbrication level within the entity/instance arborescence
   is equivalent to an imbrication level within the file arborescence.
